            Every summer night, as the sun disappears from the horizon and the heat on the ground slowly recedes, the Snack Street begins to come alive. People converge from all corners of the city and they always arrive on time, as if this were a ritual, an unwritten appointment they had with summer.

        <h3>Barbecue</h3>
        <div class="text-with-image">

          <p>
            I walked on the asphalt road, the air was filled with the tantalizing scent of grilled meats, spices and marinades. Barbecue grills hissed and sputtered as sellers called out their foods, like a bustling symphony of sights, sounds, and scents. Stores line both sides of the road, showcasing a diverse palette of treats, from spicy to sweet, crunchy to soft. These snacks look even more delicious against the warm hue of neon lights.

            The aromas became even more intoxicating as I approached a corner where a skilled pitmaster worked his magic. Clouds of savory smoke enveloped the air as he expertly basted skewers of succulent meats with a secret marinade, infusing them with a mouthwatering combination of spices and flavors. The charred edges and caramelized glazes on the barbecue created a visual feast, tempting passersby with the promise of a taste sensation.

        <h3>Cold Snacks</h3>
        <div class="text-with-image">

            <p>
              However, out of all the hustle, it was the cold snacks that made me happiest. A sip of cold drink on a hot summer day is not to be missed. Vendors serve a wide variety of cold drinks in small plastic bowls, layered with color and texture, from refreshingly sweet green bean soup to more complex concoctions of red beans, peanuts and chewy jellies. People would gather around, taking refuge from the heat, sipping on their cold drinks, and getting lost in lively conversations.
At this moment, adults leisurely enjoy their BBQ with old friends, children racing around with ice-cold treats dripping down their hands, and everyone soaking in the magic of a warm summer night. Those nights, with their rich tapestry of experiences, are forever etched in my memory, serving as a testament to the simple joys of life.

              But the snack street wasn't all about food. We affectionately called it the "night market," a place where one could find everything from quirky ornaments to rare collectibles. As a child, my eyes would widen at stalls displaying stacks of cartoon DVDs and colorful toys. A small crowd of children would gather, negotiating, trading, or simply dreaming about their next purchase.
