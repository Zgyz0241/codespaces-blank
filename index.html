              Night markets often come to life as the sun sets, so arriving early ensures you can witness the transformation from dusk to night. This allows you to explore the stalls before the crowds peak and fully appreciate the beauty.
            </li>
            <li>
              Night markets can get crowded and the weather can vary, so dress comfortably and consider the climate. Wear comfortable shoes for walking, and bring a light jacket in case the night turns cooler. 
            </li>
            <li>
              While some night markets accept credit cards, it's always a good idea to carry some cash, especially small denominations. This makes transactions smoother, especially when purchasing snacks or small items from vendors who may not have the capability to process card payments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Night markets are a perfect opportunity to indulge in local cuisine. Be adventurous and try dishes that are specialties of the region. Whether it's skewers from a barbecue stall or a unique cold snack, embracing the local flavors adds an extra layer to your night market experience.
