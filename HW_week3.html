      Every summer night, when the sun disappears from the horizon and the heat on the ground slowly recedes, the Snack Street begins to bustle with activity. People converge from all corners of the city, and they always arrive on time, as if it were a ritual, an unwritten pact they have with summer.

      <p>
        I walked down the asphalt road, the tantalizing aroma of grilled meats, spices and marinades filled the air. Barbecue grills hissed and sellers hawked their food like a bustling symphony of sights, sounds, and smells. Stores lined both sides of the road, displaying everything from spicy to sweet, crunchy to soft. The snacks look even more delicious against the warm neon colors.

        In my surroundings, food enthusiasts display a wide variety of cuisines, recommending each other and sharing the joy of discovering new cuisines. The variety of barbecue styles reflects the cultural richness of the street, showcasing global flavors ranging from savory and smoky to sweet and savory. It's a feast for the senses, where a passion for barbecue unites people in a shared appreciation of the art of grilling and the joys of a world of flavors.

      <p>
        However, in the bustling crowd, the most delightful thing for me is the cold snacks. On a hot summer day, a sip of a cold drink is definitely not to be missed. Vendors serve a wide variety of cold drinks in small plastic bowls, ranging from refreshingly sweet green bean soup to more complex concoctions such as red beans, peanuts and chewy jellies in a variety of colors and flavors. People gather around to escape the summer heat while sipping cold drinks and chatting from time to time. At this moment, adults leisurely enjoying a barbecue with old friends, children darting around with cold treats in hand, everyone reveling in the magic of a warm summer night. Those nights, those rich experiences, are forever etched in my memory as a testament to the simple pleasures of life.
